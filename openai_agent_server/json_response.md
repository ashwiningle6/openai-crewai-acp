## Song Evaluation

```json
hit_potential_score=7 target_audience='Young adults and tech enthusiasts who appreciate introspective lyrics and metaphorical storytelling.' strengths='The use of coding as a metaphor for personal growth is unique and relatable to a niche audience. The chorus is catchy with a strong hook, and the emotional depth resonates well, creating a balance of introspection and optimism.' concerns='The metaphor may be too niche for broader audiences, potentially limiting mainstream appeal. It requires strong production to enhance its emotional impact; without it, the concept might feel flat.' market_comparison='Reminds me of songs by artists like Ed Sheeran for lyrical depth and metaphoric storytelling, as well as Imagine Dragons for the blend of emotional and energetic themes.' recommendation='Needs work'
